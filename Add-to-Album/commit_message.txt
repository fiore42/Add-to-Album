it toggles favorites album correctly, and check if the photo is present


MUST HAVE:

- make rotate change the current photo, not create a new copy
- add 8 functions boxes
- support non-dark mode
- include videos (now only photos)
- extract cellSize from ImageGridView (duplicated)
- extract ImageViewModel from FullScreenImageView
- extract handlePreloading, rotateImage, refreshCurrentImage from FullScreenImageView

NICE TO HAVE:
- make the grid view update when images change
- review UI of rotate left / rotate right
- QA the permission UI at start
